<h4 class="card-title">Kepler's third law</h4>
</div>
<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
<li class="list-group-item">
<p class="text-justify">In class I claimed that Kepler's third law could be
"derived" from Newton's law of universal gravitation, <i>without</i> solving
a differential equation. This idea is important enough that it's well worth
stepping through here.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Kepler's third law is what's known as a <i>scaling
law:</i> it may not necessarily give an exact relation, but it does establish
how one quantity changes with respect to another. In this case, we'd like to
show that given a planet in an elliptical orbit around a star, its orbital
period \( T \) should scale with its orbital semi-major axis \( a \) as a
power law: \( T^2 \propto a^3 \).</p>
<p class="text-justify">To start with, let's write down the force acting on
the planet in spherical coordinates:
\[ \mathbf{F} = m_2 \, {d^2r \over dt^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}
= - {Gm_1m_2 \over r^2} \, \hat{\mathbf{r}} \]
where \( m_1 \geq m_2 \) are the masses of the star and planet, respectively.
Obviously the factors of \( m_2 \) cancel, and we're left with an
\(r\)-component of
\[ {d^2r \over dt^2} = - {Gm_1 \over r^2}. \]
Now, the left- and right-hand sides of this equation both have overall units
of acceleration. If we could isolate those and make this equation unitless,
we'd be left with <i>exactly one</i> mathematical problem that could be
re-scaled to model different masses.</p>
<p class="text-justify">We already know something about one family
of solutions to this equation: they describe orbits, and orbits are inherently
cyclical. Suppose that \( a \) and \( T \) are two constants describing
the characteristic size and duration, respectively, of one cycle in a
particular orbit. Then, write this equation in terms of the <b>unitless</b>
variables \( \rho = r/a \) and \( \tau = t/T \):
\[ {a \over T^2} \, {d^2\rho \over d\tau^2} = - {Gm_1 \over a^2} \, {1 \over \rho^2} \]
We can now pull a sneaky little trick: since \( T \) and \( a \) are generic
constants, we can lump all the constants into one (called \( k \), say),
leaving us with a single differential equation
\[ {d^2\rho \over d\tau^2} = -{k \over \rho^2} \]
and the condition that
\[ {Gm_1 T^2 \over a^3} = k. \]
But this implies \( T^2 \propto a^3 \), exactly as we wanted to show.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Consider a culture of bacteria. Initially there is a
single bacterium; after a while, through cell division, it splits into two.
A while later, two split into four, and so on. As the culture grows, its
growth <i>rate</i> speeds up in proportion.</p>
Can you model the growth of this bacteria culture?
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
<p class="text-justify">
Let \( N(t) \) represent the number of bacteria in the culture at time \( t \),
with the initial condition \( N(0) = 1 \). Since the culture's growth rate is
proportional to how many bacteria there currently are, we can model this system
with the (very simple) differential equation
\[ {dN \over dt} = \alpha N \]
where \( \alpha \gt 0 \) is a proportionality constant. Isolating variables so that
\( N \) is on the left-hand side and \( t \) is on the right, we can then
integrate directly:
\[ \int {dN \over N} = \alpha \int dt \]
This leaves us with a logarithmic relationship:
\[ \ln N = \alpha t + C \]
where \( C \) is a constant of integration.
Note, since \( N(0) = 1 \) we know that \( C = \ln[N(0)] = 0 \).
Taking the exponent of both sides, we finally have
\[ N(t) = \exp (\alpha t) \]
</p>
which is a model for the exponential growth of this bacteria culture (see
figure below).

<p class="text-justify">Suppose that, on your way to Pittsburgh from Meadville
on I-79, you take great care to make sure the distance you have left to travel
is always the same as the speed you're going, i.e. at 50 miles out you go 50
mph, and so on.</p>
How long does it take you to get to Pittsburgh?
<li class="list-group-item">
<p class="text-justify">
Let \( x(t) \) represent the distance (in miles) left to travel at time \( t \)
(in arbitrary units). Since Meadville is about 86 miles from Pittsburgh on I-79,
this sets your initial condition \( x(0) = x_0 \). For simplicity, let's assume
your motion is one-dimensional with Pittsburgh at the origin, so you're moving
in the \( -x \) direction on your way there. Your motion can be modeled as
\[ {dx \over dt} = -{x \over H} \]
where \( H \gt 0 \) is a (constant) unit conversion factor to get speed in miles
per hour. Once again isolating variables and integrating, we get
\[ \ln x = \int {dx \over x} = -{1 \over H} \int dt = -{t \over H} + C \]
where \( C \) is a constant of integration. Taking the exponent of both sides
and matching this integration constant to the initial condition, we get
\[ x(t) = x_0 \exp (-t/H) \]
</p>
which models an exponential decay process (see figure below). In other words,
while you can get <i>arbitrarily close</i> to Pittsburgh if you wait long
enough, you will never technically arrive there...

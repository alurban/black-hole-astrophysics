    "# Digging into &gamma;-ray bursts\n",
    "\n",
    "The Burst and Transient Source Experiment ([BATSE](https://gammaray.nsstc.nasa.gov/batse/)) was an instrument aboard the spaceborne Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ([CGRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_Gamma_Ray_Observatory)) that flew in low-Earth orbit from 1991 through 2000. BATSE conducted a decade-long, all-sky survey for &gamma;-ray bursts (GRBs) using a set of eight identical sodium iodide (NaI) scintillation detectors aboard the spacecraft. GRBs tend to happen at a rate of about 1/day somewhere on the sky, and can last anywhere from milliseconds to tens of minutes at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook examines a population of BATSE GRBs to understand their ensemble properties, which can shed some light (pun shamelessly intended) on the physical mechanisms that power these ultra-relativistic explosions. In the process, we will come across some common data visualization techniques in astronomy and learn how to load data directly over the interwebs without downloading a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** this is strongly related to material from week 4 of the course, themed as  [*In which things get very strange*](https://alurban.github.io/black-hole-astrophysics/week-4/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import useful packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that Python is an *interpreted* language (rather than a *compiled* one). This means you can interact directly with the Python interpreter to run your code in real-time, without having to compile it. There are many, many, many third-party software applications available through the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org)), which in general can be **imported** so you can use them in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will make heavy use of [NumPy](https://numpy.org), a fundamental Python package for numerical analysis, and [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org), a common core package for astronomy. We will also make use of Python's built-in `urllib` and `warnings` modules."

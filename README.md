PHYS 290: Black Hole Astrophysics
=================================

Welcome, black hole mechanics!

This repository hosts software and related materials for PHYS 290: Black Hole
Astrophysics, a Special Topics course offered in spring 2020 at Allegheny
College.

Access
------

To clone this repository, open a Terminal window (on Mac or Linux) and do the
following:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/src
$ cd ~/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/alurban/black-hole-astrophysics.git
```

Alternatively, you can download a ZIP-compressed version using the "clone or
download" button at the top of this page. This will work from any system.

You will be able to track upstream changes and work from this clone, but you
**will not** be able to push changes back to `master` unless I grant you
permissions. (Please [email me](mailto:aurban1@lsu.edu) if you would like to
discuss setting up push privileges.)

### Misc.

**Pro tip:** if your eyes hurt after staring at a computer screen all day,
consider using software that adjusts your monitor's color filter to reflect
indoor vs. outdoor lighting conditions, such as
[f.lux](https://justgetflux.com).

=================================

Welcome! This repository contains software and related materials for PHYS 290
(Black Hole Astrophysics), a Special Topics course offered in spring 2020 at
Allegheny College.

Access
------

To clone this repository, open a Terminal window (on Mac or Linux) and do the
following:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/src
$ cd ~/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/alurban/black-hole-astrophysics.git
```

You will be able to track upstream changes and work from this clone, but you
*will not* be able to push changes unless I grant you permissions. (Please
[email me](mailto:aurban1@lsu.edu) if you would like to discuss setting up
push privileges.)

Alternatively, you can download a ZIP-compressed version using the "clone or
download" button at the top of this page. This will work from any system.

For data science and signal processing:
* A neat [Python tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org) with focus on data
  science
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), a vast font of wisdom for coding
  and debugging
* A collection of [tutorials](https://losc.ligo.org/tutorials/) centered on
  gravitational wave signal processing

For LIGO and my associated research:
* [LIGO Livingston Observatory](http://ligo.caltech.edu/LA)
* Online version of my [curriculum vitae](http://alurban.github.io/)

Pro tip: if your eyes hurt after staring at a computer screen all day,
consider using software that adjusts your monitor's color filter to reflect
indoor vs. outdoor lighting conditions, such as
[f.lux](https://justgetflux.com).

Finally, if you're feeling overwhelmed, take a break from science with this
